-= What is this? =-
This application demonstrates an artificial chemistry. Each circle is an atom, that floats around and can become bonded to others to form a molecule. In real chemistry, the bonding rules are written like this:
    6*(CO2) + 6*(H2O) + light => C6H12O6 + 6*(O2)
where carbon dioxide and water (six of each) react (in the presence of light) to form glucose and oxygen. This is the reaction that plants use to photosynthesise.
In an artificial chemistry we use simpler rules, like this one:
    a0 + b0 => a1b2
Rather than use the atomic types seen in nature (hydrogen, oxygen, etc.) we use arbitrary letters: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' and 'f'. And rather than have complicated rules for determining which molecules will react, based on charge, valency and shape, we use the state number (0, 1, 2, ...) to decide if the reactants match. For example, in the reaction above, two atoms a0 and b0 will become bonded, and the 'a' atom will take on state 1 and the 'b' atom state 2. They could each be bonded to different atoms at the time, that doesn't matter. The types of the atoms can't change (like in real chemistry), just their states. And rather than worry about energy considerations, we assume that if a reaction rule is present then it is energetically favourable. All of these changes leave you with a very simple system but one in which you can still do some very interesting things. If you have come across cellular automata (wikipedia link) then the system will be somewhat familiar.

-= Why do all this? =-
The reason for using a strange abstraction of chemistry like this is that you can do some really cool things in a simple system. The applet above takes you through some of the possibilities. Perhaps the coolest thing you can do is template replication - the process DNA uses to make copies of itself. If you choose the right rules in the applet above you can actually get this working - follow through the challenges to find out how. The reason for using a spatial system, with atoms bouncing off each other, is that you can then do things like make a membrane out of atoms, and use it to make compartments in the space. Again, some of the challenges explore this idea.

-= How do I use the applet? =-
The applet has two parts: the collision arena on the right, full of bouncing atoms, and the controls part on the left. At the bottom of the controls area is a list box, showing the reactions that are currently active in the arena. There aren't any to start with (so no reactions happen) but you can add some by using the reaction editor controls just above. To specify a reaction, use the drop-down lists to choose the type (a-f) and state (0,1...) of the two atoms that are to react. Use the tick box between them to specify whether they should be unbonded before the reaction (no tick) or bonded (tick). Then, on the right of the 'produces' symbol (=>) specify the final states of each atom, and whether the two atoms should be bonded afterwards (tick) or unbonded (no tick). Thus you can bond two atoms together, or break them apart, or simply change their states and leave them as they were. The list of reactions is editable, so you can type reactions in by hand if you prefer, or copy-and-paste from an external editor. Use the 'update' button to let the system know that you have finished editing - it will tell you if it couldn't parse your text. To remove a reaction, select it and hit backspace or delete on your keyboard, and hit 'update' to let the system know. You can pause and run the collision arena using the buttons at the top. The 'reset' button allows you to get rid of all the bonds that have been made, and reset the atom states to their starting values (usually all zeroes). Finally, the levels selector at the bottom of the controls area lets you choose which level to explore (but work through them sequentially to start with).

There are lots of artificial chemistries, with varying levels of closeness to real chemistry. A review paper in 2001 surveyed the literature at the time. Google for artificial chemistry to find more. For artificial chemistries closely related to the one explored above, please come and read my papers.
