    Artificial chemistry low-level simulation
    Make up our own rules of construction to simulate open-ended, creative evolution

This is the motto of the OrganicBuilder, an application created by [Tim Hutton](http://www.sq3.org.uk).

In 2006, I started from the online archive and contributed : 

* online hosting at [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/organicbuilder/) and right now at github,
* [a project website](http://organicbuilder.sourceforge.net/),
* internationalisation support (English and French at the moment),
* a few code refactorings,
* a new design for the interface,
* maven description of the project,
* ...

I might be forgetting a few things.

You are welcome to watch, fork the project and create pull requests. Contact me if you have any questions.
