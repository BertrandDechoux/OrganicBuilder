<h1>ORGANIC BUILDER</h1>

<h2>Motto</h2>
<p>
    "Make up our own rules of construction to simulate open-ended,
    creative evolution. Forget all that chemistry they made you learn
    in school, we're going to make it all up as we go along. "
</p>

<h2>Short Description</h2>
<p>
    Java simulation of evolution -the process in which natural selection
    and mutation can lead to complex, sophisticated design- using artificial chemistry.
